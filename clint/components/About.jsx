      <p>
        This is a MERN stack Feedback App where users can submit their valuable feedback 
        about our services. The feedback is securely stored in a MongoDB database. 
        The backend is built using Express.js and Node.js, while the frontend uses React.js 
        to provide a smooth and interactive user experience.

        Hi, I am Akash Raj, a Full Stack Developer with experience in building web applications 
        using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). 
        I created this project to help organizations collect user feedback easily, 
        and to practice building full-stack applications integrating frontend, backend, 
        and database management.
